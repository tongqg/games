# Product Requirements Document: Gomoku Game

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a web-based Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row) game. The game will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Goals
- Create a functional Gomoku game playable in two modes: Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. AI (PvE).
- Provide a clear visual representation of the game board and pieces.
- Indicate the current player's turn.
- Detect and announce the winner when a player achieves five in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Allow players to restart the game.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Game Board:** Display a 15x15 grid representing the Gomoku board.
- **Game Modes:**
    - **Player vs. Player (PvP):** Two human players take turns on the same computer.
    - **Player vs. AI (PvE):** A human player plays against a computer-controlled opponent. The player can choose their color (Black or White).
- **Player Turns:**
    - In PvP mode, alternate turns between Black and White. Black goes first.
    - In PvE mode, the human player and AI alternate turns. If the human is Black, they go first. If the human is White, the AI (Black) goes first.
- **Placing Pieces:**
    - Human players click on an empty intersection to place their piece.
    - The AI automatically calculates and places its piece on its turn.
- **Win Condition:** The game ends when a player gets exactly five of their pieces in an unbroken row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Draw Condition:** (Optional) The game could end in a draw if the board is full and no player has won.
- **Game Over Indication:** Clearly indicate when the game is over and who the winner is (or if it's a draw).
- **Restart:** Provide a button or mechanism to restart the game.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **User Interface:** Simple, clean, and intuitive interface.
- **Performance:** The game should run smoothly in modern web browsers.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 5. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- (Moved AI opponent to Functional Requirements)
- Online multiplayer.
- Different board sizes.
- Piece capture (Renju rules).
- Score tracking.

## 6. AI Training Requirements
- **Training Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism to train the AI opponent. This could involve:
    - **Self-Play:** The AI plays against itself repeatedly to learn optimal strategies.
    - **Reinforcement Learning:** Use algorithms like Q-learning or similar techniques where the AI learns from rewards based on game outcomes.
- **Training Initiation:** Provide a way to start the AI training process (e.g., a button in the UI, a specific command).
- **Training Progress/Feedback:** (Optional) Display some indication of the training progress or the AI's improving strength.
- **Model Persistence:** (Optional) Allow saving the trained AI model state so it doesn't need retraining every time the page loads.
- **Integration:** The trained AI should be usable in the Player vs. AI (PvE) mode.
