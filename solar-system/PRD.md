# Product Requirements Document: 3D Solar System Simulation

## 1. Overview

This project aims to create an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system, including the Sun and the eight major planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). The simulation will allow users to visualize the approximate positions of the planets on a specific date.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide an engaging and educational visualization of the solar system.
*   Accurately represent the relative positions of planets based on a user-selected date.
*   Offer interactive 3D controls for exploring the model.

## 3. Features

*   **3D Solar System Model:**
    *   Render the Sun and the eight planets in a 3D space.
    *   Represent planetary orbits (optional, can be simplified as circles or ellipses initially).
    *   Basic texturing or coloring for differentiation.
*   **Date Input:**
    *   Provide an input field (e.g., date picker) for the user to select a specific date.
*   **Planetary Position Calculation:**
    *   Implement logic to calculate the approximate orbital positions of the planets based on the selected date. (Note: High precision astronomical calculations can be complex; simplified models are acceptable for this scope).
*   **3D Interaction:**
    *   Allow users to rotate the 3D view using mouse drag or touch gestures.
    *   Allow zooming in and out.
*   **Integration:**
    *   Add a link to this simulation on the main project index page (`index.html`).

## 4. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

*   Highly accurate astronomical calculations (e.g., accounting for orbital inclination, eccentricity beyond simple ellipses).
*   Moons, asteroids, comets, or dwarf planets.
*   Realistic scaling of distances and sizes (will use representational scaling).
*   Advanced physics simulation.
*   Specific historical event visualization.

## 5. Technology Stack

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript
*   A 3D graphics library (e.g., Three.js)
